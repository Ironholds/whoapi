`whoapi` provides functionality to query the [Whoapi domain information database](https://whoapi.com/). You can use this to get registration and whois data
about a domain, geolocate its underlying IP address, check its popularity, and a variety of other things.

## Creating a token

The first thing you need to use this service is a token; something that contains your API key and whatever options you'd like to set,
such as the user agent. To obtain an API key, see the [whoapi website](https://whoapi.com/signin.html); then pass that key and the other options to  `whoapi_token`.
