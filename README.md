###Description

[whoapi.com](https://whoapi.com) is a repository of information about domains, including registration date,
WHOIS data, page rank and similar metadata. <code>whoapi</code> provides a simple and uniform binding to their
API, allowing for automatic data retrieval in R.

It is currently in very, very early development.
